# üü° Pac-Man on Desktop Icons

**Pac-Man, but on your Windows desktop!**  
This experimental and fun C# Windows Forms project lets you control a Pac-Man character over your **actual desktop icons** ‚Äî using them as points in a virtual maze!

## üéÆ Features

- Control Pac-Man over your desktop with arrow keys or UI buttons  
- Moves real desktop icons in real-time  
- Pac-Man image updates based on direction  
- Dot-eating animation using background drawing  
- Ghosts can be dropped onto the desktop as `.png` files  
- Sound effects using NAudio (e.g., starting sound)


## üõ† How it Works

This game manipulates the Windows desktop directly by:
- Accessing the **ListView** handle of the desktop icons  
- Reading and updating icon positions via **Windows API (SendMessage)**  
- Drawing Pac-Man and game effects using a **custom full-screen bitmap**  
- Updating the actual **desktop wallpaper** to reflect game changes  
- Playing sounds using **NAudio**  
- All logic wrapped in a user-friendly **Windows Forms UI**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This only works on **Windows** desktops with icon auto-arrange turned off.
